# voucherSystem
Made using Netbeans IDE for a school project.

# REQUIREMENTS
As instructed by my teacher, we used XAMPP inorder to create our database, but if you're an expert you can use any. I've provided the file (accounts.sql) with the database.

# PERSONAL NOTE
Idk how to use java in VSCode, only in Netbeans IDE. This program also uses GUI feature in Netbeans IDE.
